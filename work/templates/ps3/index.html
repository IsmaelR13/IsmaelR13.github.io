    <div class="introduction">	
      <p>The popular American card game Uno has simple rules, right?<br> WRONG!<br> 
        
        Here are some rules you're probably playing incorrectly.</p>	
    </div>	
    <div class="red">	
      <h2>Red -- If you don't have a card to play, you only have to pick up one card</h2>	
      <p>You don't have to keep drawing cards until you get one that matches the discard pile, and you can even play it right away!</p>	
    </div>	
    <div class="blue">	
      <h2>Blue -- You can't stack or chain cards</h2>	
      <p>Sorry, you can't make your little brother pick up 6 cards by playing a draw 2 after a draw 4. If a draw card is played, the next player picks up the cards and misses their turn.</p>	
    </div>	
    <div class="yellow">	
      <h2>Yellow --  You can win with an action card</h2>	
      <p>Wild, Skip, even Reverse - doesn't matter as long as it matches the color!</p>	
    </div>	
    <div class="green">	
      <h2>Green -- In two player mode Reverse is treated as a Skip</h2>	
      <p>The other player's turn is skipped and you can play again right away. Same with draw cards!</p>	
    </div>
